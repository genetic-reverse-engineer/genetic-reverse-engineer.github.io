# Prerequisites

* [5.111SC](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/5-111sc-principles-of-chemical-science-fall-2014/)


# Notes

Things that interest me:

* cancer
* enzymes and enzyme synthesis


## Class 1

* Slides? Only in video

* The book.  Hm...

Membranes == lipid billayers??
    Semi-permeable membranes, hydrophobic things can go across them

prokaryotes - cyanobacteria
eukaryotes - larger, more complex single-cells than prokaryotes

humans have 3bn. base pairs

Human diversity is encompassed in 0.1% of genome

She mentioned a "molecular clock" that may be a historical look at how dna emerged.  Can I find this?

Only 1.5% of base pairs are coded into proteins

    Thousand genome project
    Human Cell Atlas
    Cancer genomes (NCI)

Proteins are positively charged and negate the negative charges of DNA strands

Chemical covalent and non-covalent bonding will be important going through this...

After watching this class, I think that 5.111SC may be a prerequisite.
