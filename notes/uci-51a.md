## Week 1, Lecture 1

An unstable nucleus is radioactive, like Carbon-14.  Half-life is effectively, "the percentage of Carbon-14 left in a thing after a given time."  It will lose half of its atoms after 5730 years.  There's an exected % of Carbon-14 (a measurable trace) in a ratio of all Carbon atoms in a sample.  This is carbon dating

* Fishhook arro shows movement of 1 electron (1 e-)
* Interesting.  Molecules are held together by electrostatic interaction (attraction of opposite charges) in a crystal lattice, not due to the electron sharing
* Electronegativity trends
  * Farther right => greater electronegativity
  * Farter up => greater electronegativity
  * So, F is most electronegative. 
  * If EN > ~1.8 between two atoms (in general), the electron will be transferred and the bond will be ionic.  ∃ exceptions

## Week 1, Lecture 2

* Exception to the EN > 1.8 ionic bond rule is HF
* Most of OChem is covalently bonded, joined by sharing electrons
* HONC-1234 --> H and Halogens make 1 bond, O makes 2, N makes 3, C makes 4.  THis is for `neutral atoms`, not ions
* A charged atom is one that has a formal charge, which is an atom that doesn't exhibit the expected # of valence electrons
![Formal Charge Chart](./uci-51a/uci-51a__L2__formal-charges.png)
* Aside - What causes ions to happen??
* Funky - C+ only makes 3 bonds despite not then having a full valence shell??  Or can we read this "when Carbon is bound in this structure, this is the ionic configuration it will hav?
* Formula = (# valence e-) - 1/2 # bonding e-) - (# nonbonding e-)
  * Example => H5C2NO =>
    * For O => 6 - 1/2(2) - 6 = -1
    * FOr N => 5 - 1/2(8) - 0 = +1
    * This is easier to see if you look at teh structure
* Exceptions to the octet rule
  * Third row and higher elements have `d orbitals` available for bonding, so they sometimes exceed an octet in their valence shell.  H2SO4 and H3PO4 are examples.  In H2SO4, the S has 12 shared electrons.  In H3PO4, P has 10
  * Ugh, then how do you reason about these???
* Boron, like Carbon, can make 3 shared bonds and leave an open valence shell.  Example is BF3, B has only 6 valence electrons.  Open shell compounds can accept a pair of electrons to complete an octet, which it does in a chemical reaction.  Example is the Lewis acid called Boron tri-fluoride
  * NH3 + BF3 = H3BNF3 in a new covalent bond, and the N would be cationic (+1) and the Boron would be anionic (-1)
* Aside: I really need to be able to embed drawings
* Representations:
  * Molecular formula (C2H5O)+
  * Condensed Structure CH3CH(O+)H 
  * ^^^^ These are the same molecules
* Another example:
  * CH3C(CH3)2CH2Cl

* Another hard example/exception: CH3CO2H or CH3COOH
  * Helpful CO2 in a condensed typically means C bonds with 2 O
