title: Bioinformatics Curriculum for Computer Scientists
email: genetic-reverse-engineer@gmail.com
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  This is a proposed curriculum to cross-train into Bioinformatics
  as a computer scientist, based entirely on MIT Open Courseware.  
  This path more commonly goes the other way, where a biologist/chemist
  will undertake the study of computer science and statistics to 
  learn how to aply machine learning and algorithms to existing 
  research.
