# Curricula

The below outlines three different curricula; MIT, UMBC, and Johns Hopkins.  The checked content is content that I've either completed since beginning this endeavor, or that I satisfied as part of my undergraduate or graduate studies in Computer Science

## MIT Curriculum  

The content here is designed from a combination of prerequisites I could identify along with MIT's interdisciplinary [BS in CS and Molecular Biology](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-molecular-biology-course-6-7/)

A note on MIT numbering:

* 5 => Chemistry
* 6 => Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
* 7 => Biology

Helpful: 
* https://eecsis.mit.edu/numbering.html#6.10xx
* https://eecsis.mit.edu/numbering.html#6.47xx

## To Do

- [ ] Find coursework on biochemistry
- [ ] Find coursework on macromolecular biology
- [ ] Find coursework on genetics/epigenetics

### Required - Mathematics and Programming

* [x] 6.100A - Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python
* [x] 6.100B - Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science 
    * Best satisfied by [6.0002 - Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-06-cell-biology-spring-2007/) (Erik Grimson, Fall 2016) - This is Python 3.5, so it might be best to start here
* [x] 6.1200J - Mathematics for Computer Science

### Prerequisites/Refreshers - Biology

* Choose 1
    * [ ] [7.013 - Introduction to Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-013-introductory-biology-spring-2018/) (Angelika Amon, Spring 2018)  - Genomics focus
    * [ ] [7.016 - Introductory Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-016-introductory-biology-fall-2018/) (Barbara Imperiali, Fall 2018) - Focus on biological function @ molecular level, gene regulation, etc.
Note: The above may overlap a lot with 7.03 - Genetics
* [ ] [5.111SC - Principles of Chemical Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/5-111sc-principles-of-chemical-science-fall-2014/) (Catherine Drennan, Fall 2014)

### Prerequisites - Chemistry

* [ ] [5.12 - Organic Chemistry I](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/5-12-organic-chemistry-i-spring-2005/) (Kimberly Berkowski, Spring 2005)
* Individually, the following classes are not on OCW, but there may be an older combined one
    * [ ] 5.601 - Thermodynamics I
    * [ ] 5.602 - Thermodynamics II and Kinetics
    * Satisfy with [5.60 - Thermodynamics and Kinetics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/5-60-thermodynamics-kinetics-spring-2008/) (Spring 2008)

### Foundational

* [x] 6.1010 - Fundamentals of Programming - This course is Python-based
    * Best satisfied through ocw by [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) (Ana Bell, Fall 2016)
    * This could be weird because I don't know whether Python3 has taken over Bioinformatics, so this may be a little dated
    * It is hard to tell how this differs from 6.100A
* [x] 6.1210 - Introduction to Algorithms
    * Best satisfied through ocw by [Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/) (Erik Demaine, Spring 2020)
* [x] 5.1220J - Design and Analysis of Algorithms
    * Best satisfied through ocw by [Design and Analysis of Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/) (Erik Demaine, Spring 2015)
* [ ] [7.03 - Genetics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-03-genetics-fall-2004/) (Chris Kaiser, Fall 2004)

    * Satisfy with [6.047 - Computational Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-047-computational-biology-fall-2015/) (Manolis Kellis, Fall 2015).  This is the same instructor as 6.8701; in fact, per the re-numbering, this is the same class, just older
* [ ] 6.8711 - Computational Systems Biology: Deep Learning in the Life Sciences
    * Satisfy with [7.91J - Foundations of Computational and Systems Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-91j-foundations-of-computational-and-systems-biology-spring-2014/) (Christopher Burge, Spring 2014). This is the older numbering
* [ ] 7.093 - Modern Biostatistics - can't find it on OCW
* [ ] 7.094 - Modern Computational Biology - can't find it on OCW
* [ ] 7.33J - Evolutionary Biology: Concepts, Models, and Computation
    * Possibly satisfy with [6.877J - Computational Evolutionary Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-877j-computational-evolutionary-biology-fall-2005/) (Robert Berwick, Fall 2005) - Same instructor
